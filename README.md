## Fragrance Palette

Home perfumers and fragrance hobbyists often find it challenging to create basic perfume formulations that match their desired scent ideas. The Fragrance-Palette Generator simplifies this process by offering a beginner-friendly approach: users **describe** the kind of **scent** they want (e.g. "fresh citrus with hints of vanilla"), and the system identifies the appropriate fragrance family and suggests a simple **three-note structure** (top, middle, base) with clear **mixing instructions**. This approach makes perfume creation accessible even to beginners without requiring advanced knowledge of ingredient proportions or complex formulation techniques.
